Urbanist is a low-contrast, geometric sans-serif inspired by Modernist design and typography. The project was launched by Corey Hu in 2020 with 9 weights and accompanying italics. Conceived from elementary shapes, Urbanist's neutrality makes it a versatile display font for print and digital mediums. The font is currently available as a variable font with "Weight" and "Italic" axes.
